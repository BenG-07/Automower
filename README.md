# Automower
 
This is a very old program of mine.
It simulates an automower mowing the lawn.
<br>The mower will drive around in random directions until every tile is mowed at least 10 times.

Do not question anything of the code - it was one of my first projects and I had no idea what I was doing + it was a task to do some things in certain ways (e.g. use delegates). I think it is just fun to have these memories to look back.
